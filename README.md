# Alinyo
## A Prototype for Interactive Schedule Generation

### Project Vision

Alinyo is the first iteration and prototype for a more ambitious project: an interactive AI assistant capable of generating, managing, and adapting fully customized schedules for users. The ultimate goal is to create a tool that helps people organize not just their health, but their entire day-to-day life, including work, study, and leisure.

The Current Prototype: A Wellness Consultant
This repository contains the core component of that vision. The current version of Alinyo focuses on the most critical task: gathering and understanding nuanced user information through natural conversation. It operates as a wellness-focused chatbot that:

Simulates a consultation with a psychiatrist to understand a user's lifestyle.

Asks a series of in-depth questions about daily routines, health, and habits.

Generates a personalized wellness plan as a proof-of-concept for its analytical capabilities.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Google Gemini API, python-dotenv.
